# Tasks: Non-SQLModel Root Objects

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-non-sqlmodel-roots/`

**Prerequisites**: [plan.md](./plan.md), [spec.md](./spec.md), [research.md](./research.md), [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [contracts/api.md](./contracts/api.md), [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md)

**Tests**: Test tasks ARE included — quickstart.md defines a 3-layer Coverage Matrix (~34 tests) that maps to spec FRs and Edge Cases. Tests are integral to this feature, not optional.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story (US1 = virtual root + add_virtual_entities, US2 = DefineSubset from BaseModel + composite relationships, US3 = ER/Voyager rendering). Each story is independently testable.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- File paths are absolute under repo root (`src/nexusx/...`, `tests/...`)

## Path Conventions

Single-project library layout. Source in `src/nexusx/`, tests in `tests/`. Matches existing 002 / 003 specs.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Verify clean starting state, confirm understanding of design docs.

- [X] T001 Confirm clean git state on `master` and create feature branch `004-non-sqlmodel-roots`
- [X] T002 [P] Re-read [research.md](./research.md) R1–R8 and [contracts/api.md](./contracts/api.md) Contracts 1–6 to confirm touch points before implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Type-widening and infrastructure changes that ALL user stories depend on. MUST complete before any US work begins.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: US1 / US2 / US3 all build on these. Skipping means rework.

- [X] T003 [P] Widen type annotations on `get_custom_relationships()` (parameter) and `Relationship.target_entity` (return type) from `type[SQLModel]` to `type` / `type[BaseModel]` in `src/nexusx/relationship.py` — pure annotation change, body unchanged (research.md R2)
- [X] T004 [P] Add `self._frozen: bool = False` initialization to `ErManager.__init__` and a `has_entity(entity: type) -> bool` convenience method in `src/nexusx/loader/registry.py` (research.md R3, R5)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready — `add_virtual_entities()` and Resolver fallback can now be implemented on top.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 — Plain BaseModel Virtual Root (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: A backend developer can declare a plain `BaseModel` root (e.g., `CurrentUser`), register it via `er.add_virtual_entities([...])`, and have `Resolver().resolve(root)` populate `resolve_*` / `post_*` / custom-relationship fields — without touching `_subset_registry`.

**Independent Test**: Quickstart S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 + S5 pass. The end-to-end `CurrentUser → AgentDTO` flow from Issue #87's Minimum Acceptance Criteria runs without errors.

### Tests for User Story 1 (Layer 1 — API contract) ⚠️ Write first, must FAIL before implementation

- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Write Layer 1 tests for `add_virtual_entities()` contract in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py`: happy-path registration, post-`create_resolver` RuntimeError, SQLModel input TypeError, duplicate registration ValueError, non-BaseModel input TypeError, empty-list no-op (quickstart S1, S3, S4, S5)

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T006 [US1] Implement `ErManager.add_virtual_entities(entities: list[type[BaseModel]]) -> None` body in `src/nexusx/loader/registry.py` — reads each class's `__relationships__` via widened `get_custom_relationships()`, wires `RelationshipInfo` entries into `self._registry`, validates BaseModel-not-SQLModel / non-duplicate / not-frozen (contracts/api.md Contract 1)
- [X] T007 [US1] Set `self._frozen = True` at top of `ErManager.create_resolver()` in `src/nexusx/loader/registry.py` (research.md R3)
- [X] T008 [US1] Implement unified source-resolution fallback in `Resolver._scan_auto_load_fields` in `src/nexusx/resolver.py` — when `get_subset_source(node_type)` returns None, check `self._registry.has_entity(node_type)` and use `node_type` as source (research.md R5, ~10 LOC)

### Tests for User Story 1 (Layer 2 — Capability parity)

- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Add `resolve_*` and `post_*` on virtual root tests in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` (quickstart S2) — verify identical behavior to SQLModel-rooted DTOs
- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Add `post_default_handler` on virtual root test in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` — finalizer fires after all named `post_*` complete
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Add sequential-`resolve`-no-leak test with virtual roots in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` — regression for #293 clone semantics across the boundary

**Checkpoint**: Plain BaseModel virtual root fully functional. Quickstart S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 pass. Issue #87 minimum acceptance criteria met for the virtual-root-only path.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 — DefineSubset from BaseModel + Composite Roots (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: A developer can declare a `DefineSubset` DTO sourced from a plain `BaseModel` (schema subset of an external model), AND declare custom relationships on virtual roots that span the SQLModel / BaseModel boundary transparently.

**Independent Test**: Quickstart S9 + S10 pass. A `DefineSubset` DTO sourced from a BaseModel works for direct construction; when the BaseModel source is also registered via `add_virtual_entities`, auto-load fires through the source's `__relationships__`.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T012 [P] [US2] Widen DefineSubset source validation in `src/nexusx/subset.py:544` from `issubclass(entity_kls, SQLModel)` to `issubclass(entity_kls, BaseModel)`; update error message to mention both SQLModel and BaseModel are accepted (research.md R8)
- [X] T013 [P] [US2] Widen `_subset_registry` type annotation in `src/nexusx/subset.py:53` from `dict[type[BaseModel], type[SQLModel]]` to `dict[type[BaseModel], type[BaseModel]]` (research.md R8)
- [X] T014 [US2] Clarify `_orm_to_dto` applicability in `src/nexusx/resolver.py:663` — rename or update docstring to indicate it's only invoked for SQLModel sources; BaseModel sources are constructed directly by the user (research.md R8)

### Tests for User Story 2 (Layer 1 + Layer 2)

- [X] T015 [P] [US2] Write DefineSubset-from-BaseModel Layer 1 tests in `tests/test_definesubset_basemodel.py` (quickstart S9): schema subsetting works, `__subset_fields__` populated, direct construction works, `_orm_to_dto` not invoked
- [X] T016 [P] [US2] Write DefineSubset-from-registered-BaseModel Layer 2 test in `tests/test_definesubset_basemodel.py` (quickstart S10): DTO + registered source + auto-load fires
- [X] T017 [P] [US2] Mirror `TestExposeAs` from `tests/test_context.py` with virtual root in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` — single-level + multi-level expose
- [X] T018 [P] [US2] Mirror `TestSendToCollector` from `tests/test_context.py` with virtual root in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` — basic + flat mode + multi-collector
- [X] T019 [P] [US2] Mirror `TestCollectorFlatNest` and `TestCollectorLevelByLevel` with virtual root in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py`
- [X] T020 [P] [US2] Mirror `TestCollectorIdentity` (same alias = same instance) with virtual root in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py`
- [X] T021 [P] [US2] Add virtual→virtual relationship test in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` (Edge Case A) — both endpoints are BaseModel
- [X] T022 [P] [US2] Add same-BaseModel-referenced-by-multiple-relationships test in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` (Edge Case H) — verify single virtual node, multiple edges
- [X] T023 [P] [US2] Add subset-field-name + relationship-name collision test in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py` (Edge Case J) — relationship loader takes precedence
- [X] T024 [P] [US2] Add unregistered-BaseModel-source test in `tests/test_definesubset_basemodel.py` (Edge Case I) — schema subsetting works but auto-load does not fire

**Checkpoint**: DefineSubset from BaseModel fully functional. Virtual roots participate in cross-layer flows identically to SQLModel roots. FR-005 satisfied.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 — ER / Voyager Virtual Node Rendering (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: A project with mixed SQLModel entities and non-SQLModel roots generates an ER diagram and opens Voyager without exceptions; virtual roots appear as visually-distinguished nodes (`shape=note`, `«virtual»` stereotype, `cluster_virtual` group).

**Independent Test**: Quickstart S6 passes. `ErDiagram` data class carries `virtual_entities: list[type[BaseModel]]`; DOT output contains the virtual node with the right shape/label/cluster; edges between virtual and SQLModel entities are drawn.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T025 [US3] Add virtual-node branch to `ErDiagram.from_sqlmodel()` (or equivalent entry point) in `src/nexusx/er_diagram.py` — pre-partition input by `isinstance(entity, SQLModel)`; guard `sa_inspect()` to only run on SQLModel entities; virtual entities skip column/FK extraction (research.md R4)
- [X] T026 [P] [US3] Add DOT emission branch for virtual nodes in `src/nexusx/voyager/er_diagram_dot.py` — `shape=note`, `style=filled, fillcolor="#FFF9C4"`, label `«virtual»\n{ClassName}`, grouped in `cluster_virtual` with dashed border (research.md R6)
- [X] T027 [US3] Verify / adjust `voyager/type_helper.py` to handle plain BaseModel sources without crashing — likely no change needed since it already handles `ICollector` and reads `model_fields`, but verify (research.md R4)

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T028 [P] [US3] Write ER diagram rendering tests in `tests/test_virtual_entities_er.py` (quickstart S6): mixed SQLModel + virtual generates without exception, virtual node has correct shape/label/cluster, edges drawn between virtual and SQLModel entities
- [X] T029 [P] [US3] Add zero-virtual-entities regression test in `tests/test_virtual_entities_er.py` — output is bit-identical to today's SQLModel-only ER generation
- [X] T030 [P] [US3] Add Voyager integration smoke test in `tests/test_virtual_entities_er.py` — Voyager opens without exception on a mixed graph

**Checkpoint**: All three user stories independently functional. ER/Voyager no longer crashes on virtual roots; visual distinction clear.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Regression protection, performance verification, documentation.

- [X] T031 [P] Add Layer 3 regression tests in `tests/test_virtual_entities.py`: virtual root has no `__table__`, `sa_inspect()` rejects virtual root class, Resolver accepts unregistered plain BaseModel without `__relationships__` (no-op), Resolver behavior on unregistered plain BaseModel with `__relationships__` matches spec Edge Case B
- [X] T032 [P] Run full existing test suite (`pytest tests/`) and verify all 1025 prior tests still pass unchanged (FR-008, SC-003)
- [X] T033 [P] Run resolver benchmarks and verify zero overhead for SQLModel-only paths (i.e., when `add_virtual_entities` is never called, behavior is bit-identical to today) — performance goal from plan.md
- [X] T034 [P] Update `quickstart.md` to reflect actual test names and final scenario numbering (S8 was merged into S11 during planning)
- [X] T035 [P] Update `docs/` (or `CLAUDE.md` if applicable) with the new `add_virtual_entities()` API and the widened `DefineSubset.__subset__` source — point at the migration from `_subset_registry` hack (SC-006)
- [X] T036 Code cleanup: remove any temporary debug logging, run `ruff check --fix` across all touched files, verify `mypy` (if configured) passes

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies — start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 — BLOCKS all user stories
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 — implements `add_virtual_entities` + Resolver fallback
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2 — DefineSubset widening is independent of US1 implementation, but Layer 2 parity tests benefit from US1's runtime path being available
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (needs virtual entities registered before they can be rendered)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 — no dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 in parallel with US1 — DefineSubset widening touches different files; but the cross-boundary parity tests (T017–T024) require US1's `add_virtual_entities` + Resolver fallback to be functional. Recommend: T012–T014 in parallel with US1; T015–T024 after US1 checkpoint.
- **US3 (P3)**: MUST follow US1 — ER rendering needs virtual entities to exist in `_registry`

### Within Each User Story

- Layer 1 tests written first, must FAIL before implementation
- Implementation proceeds in dependency order (registry → resolver → rendering)
- Layer 2 parity tests + checkpoint validation before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 2 tasks T003 + T004 are `[P]` (different files: `relationship.py` vs `loader/registry.py`)
- Phase 3 Layer 2 tests T009, T010, T011 are `[P]` (same file but logically independent test functions; safe to author together)
- Phase 4 implementation T012, T013, T014 are `[P]` within the story
- Phase 4 Layer 2 mirror tests T015–T024 are all `[P]` (different test functions, no shared state)
- Phase 5 rendering tasks T025 (`er_diagram.py`) and T026 (`voyager/er_diagram_dot.py`) are `[P]` (different files)
- Phase 6 polish tasks T031–T035 are all `[P]`

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 Layer 2 Mirror Tests

```bash
# After US1 checkpoint, launch all Layer 2 mirror tests in parallel:
Task: "Mirror TestExposeAs with virtual root in tests/test_virtual_entities.py"           # T017
Task: "Mirror TestSendToCollector with virtual root in tests/test_virtual_entities.py"   # T018
Task: "Mirror TestCollectorFlatNest with virtual root in tests/test_virtual_entities.py" # T019
Task: "Mirror TestCollectorIdentity with virtual root in tests/test_virtual_entities.py" # T020
```

Each is a self-contained test function or class — no shared fixtures beyond the standard `session_factory` fixture.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001, T002)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T003, T004) — CRITICAL, blocks everything
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T005–T011)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `pytest tests/test_virtual_entities.py -v`; all Layer 1 + Layer 2 tests pass; quickstart S1–S5 verified
5. Merge PR 1 — `add_virtual_entities` is now usable, Issue #87's minimum acceptance criteria met for the virtual-root-only path

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (PR base)
2. US1 → Test independently → **PR 1: runtime path MVP**
3. US2 → Test independently → **PR 2: DefineSubset widening + parity tests**
4. US3 → Test independently → **PR 3: ER/Voyager rendering**
5. Polish → **PR 4 (or squash into 3): regression + performance + docs**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With one developer (recommended for this feature — moderate scope): sequential in priority order. With two developers:

- Developer A: US1 → US3 (US3 depends on US1, natural handoff)
- Developer B: US2 (independent of US1 after Phase 2; DefineSubset widening + parity tests)
- Both: Phase 6 polish split by file

---

## Notes

- `[P]` tasks = different files OR different independent test functions, no dependencies
- `[Story]` label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Layer 1 tests MUST fail before implementation (TDD); Layer 2 / Layer 3 tests can be written alongside or after
- Commit after each task or logical group (suggested: one commit per task, squash within PR)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same-file conflicts within a `[P]` group, cross-story dependencies that break independence
